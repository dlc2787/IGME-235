# Wehat Fight Club
## High Concept
Wehat fight club will be a game that mixes real time and turn based combat, where you can freely move and attack as fast as you can navigate a menu. This game is loosely inspired by an old megadrive game called Madou Monogatari (which itself became a much more famous series today) and Pokémon.
## Genre
This game will be a strategy action/fighting game in which you have to decide where, when, and how to attack.
## Platforms
This game will be primarily be played on mobile but will also be available universally.
## Story
In this bizarre world, everyone has a special red panda known as a Wehat that always sticks with you. They often take after their humans, adopting personalities and aesthetic senses. Wehats will help their humans with most things, but their true value shines in confrontation. When people are at odds, their Wehats will engage in magical combat to settle the score. Some people will have Wehat matches for fun and sport, and others only when they would normally fight. You’ve just turned 12, the age at which you are legally allowed to participate in Wehat matches, and the first thing you do is sign up for your school’s Wehat fight club.
## Aesthetics
The game will be done in a cartoonish style, with energetic looped background music.
## Gameplay
### Mechanics
You can freely move around your side of the battlefield to avoid attacks. To attack, you must open and navigate an attack menu. Attacking will be based on how fast you can find the attack you want, as you cannot move while attacking. Attacks will have various ranges, effects, and damage, and some attacks will power up your other attacks. Most importantly, you get to customize your Wehat both aesthetically and for combat, as they can pair attacks with different effects.
### Control
On mobile, there will be a digital thumbpad for movement, as well as a jump and menu button. The menu is navigable by either touch, thumbpad, or both, and sometimes certain attacks may ask you to tap the screen after the menu is closed. On pc, WASD or arrow keys can move Wehat, with space tied to jump. Enter and the arrow keys are used to navigate the attack menu. On console, either stick is used for movement, while right button and any stick are used for menu navigation. Bottom button is jump.
### New Players
Anyone can fight ai opponents or other people, and first-time players can get a story introduction and tutorial in a slowed down fight against an ai.
### Experienced Players
The only skill caps in this game are your speed and what attack/effect combinations you can come up with in your strategy. Players will learn with experience as they experiment and figure out what works, and what doesn’t really.

## Other
A database of attacks and effects might be good to store info. Not sure exactly w(e)hat I want to for this yet. This whole thing might also be way too ambitions and need to be scaled back.
